To compile the project you will need Qt4 development libraries, that
can be downloaded under trolltech's website. Once installed, run the
Qt Console, navigate to the place where this file is found and type
'build'. The results will be put under release/ folder. To run the
application you can
	a) inside the console, type release/douml.exe or
	b) put Qt dlls under release/ and double-click douml.exe or
	c) put the folder that Qt is installed under your PATH variable or
	d) figure out how to link with qt static libraries.
